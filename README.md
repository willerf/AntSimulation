## AntSimulation


## Inspiration
I was watching ants crawl across the ground, and even though the ground had no apparent path, the ants would always walk along in the exact same pattern. This inspired me to look into how ants always seemed to know where they were going despite no visible path. This introduced me to how ants use pheromones to track to food and home. I decided to implement this in my project. The idea was to create relatively simple rules among all of the ants which in turn would lead to a collective intelligence when many ants were spawned together.
